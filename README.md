# opencv_webcams
Different Python code files that uses OpenCV to work with your Webcam.

In order for these code files to execute successfully you will need to download OpenCV so your IDE editor's compiler recognizes OpenCV.

My name is Todd Kennedy, I am an Informatics Major and these Python code files were acquired for an Independent Research Project class I took at the University at Albany in New York in the USA.

The Lecturer and Project Overseer for the class was Professor Dr. George Berg Ph.D.
